# email-generator
Beginners should watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJobMzcmoMo) and follow along before implementing the code from this repo.

Remember to test with burner emails and use this code with burner emails as the sender. Gmail has an email limit of 500 emails per day (day = 24 hour period) for a default personal account. (G Suite accounts can send 2,000 emails per day.) 

Also remeber that the "block sender" button on gmail is easy to find and, once clicked, will send all your mail to spam. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that means sending a lot of emails fast might be the move.
