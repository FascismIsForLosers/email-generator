# email-generator
People new to Python should watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJobMzcmoMo) and follow along before implementing the code. This will help the code make sense.

Remember to test the code with burner emails and use burner emails as the sender after testing as well. Gmail has an email limit of 500 emails per day (day = 24 hour period) for a default personal account. (G Suite accounts can send 2,000 emails per day.) You should expect to lose whatever email you use for this, just in case. I haven't experienced that yet but it can happen.

Also remember that the "block sender" button on gmail is easy to find and, once clicked, will send all your mail to spam. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that means sending a lot of emails fast might be the move. Let me know if that's dumb. I care more about being effective than feeling smart.
