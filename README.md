# email-generator
People new to Python should watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJobMzcmoMo) and follow along before implementing the code. This will help the code make sense.

People familiar with Python, I used an .env file but that's of course optional. .env file contents are:
  EMAIL_ADDRESS = ""   # email address
  EMAIL_PASSWORD = ""  # Generated app password

Remember to test the code with burner emails and use burner emails as the sender after testing as well. You should expect to lose whatever email you use for this, just in case. I haven't experienced that yet but it can happen.

Keep in mind that gmail does have [daily email limits per user account](https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852?hl=en). I send 490 emails per burner email account for simplicity.

The [block sender](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/8151?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) button on gmail is easy to find and, once clicked, will send all your mail to the recipent straight to the recipeint's spam folder. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that means sending a lot of emails fast might be the move. Let me know if that's dumb. I care more about being effective than feeling smart.
